# bet-risk

This is a sample risk application for a betting system.

The solution is currently in pre-alpha development.

To run, load the BetRisk solution and start BetRisk.WebApi and BetRisk.Ui.Web. If you change the running ports, be sure to change the CORS origins on the BetsController and the CustomersController as well as the baseApiUrl in the BetRisk.js file.

### TODO:
* Application logic
* --Configure DI--
* Connect controllers to application logic
* More test coverage
